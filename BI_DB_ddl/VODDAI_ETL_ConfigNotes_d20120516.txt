VODDAI / SCTE ETL Integration Testing, Thursday 17-MAY-2012:
=============================================================

1.  Create the DAI_REPORTING schema to store the 10 ADS Reference Tables
2.  Create the DAI_REPORTING_ODS schema to store 5 SCTE logging and 1 Aggregation Table
3.  Grant SELECT on DAI_REPORTING Tables to DAI_REPORTING_ODS (used in aggregation SQL)
4.  Update my DAI Transforms with new Database Connections information (*.kdb)
5.  Update my DAI Transforms to ensure Schemas and Tables are idnetified correctly, both Source and Target)














notes:
  When I ran an "initial load" of Placement Request files, 123 records were logged as errors.  I researched 1 of these:
  
  	I captured a single Message ID from the error log and used "grep" to find which file or files contained that 
  	Message ID.  grep identified the file as "placement-requests.g.2012-03-16.xml".
  	
  	I found the associated Message ID on line #214.
  	
  	The CLIENT element was missing the Terminal Address attribute, which we have as a NOT NULL field in our SCTE_REQUEST Table.
