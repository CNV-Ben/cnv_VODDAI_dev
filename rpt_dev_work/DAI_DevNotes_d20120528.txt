Campaign Manager is expected to rollover ADS Log-4-J files once per hour
Log Splitter splits the Log-4-J files into 3 separate types (Requests, Responses, and PSNs), paired 1-for-1 per ADS

I need to be able to capture some metadata about the Pentaho Jobs I run, such as
	job run event id
	start time
	end time
	overall totals loaded

Our reporting might be consistently "x" hours delayed and support hourly reporting

How do we build our ETL to correctly handle duplicate data?
What happens if Log Splitter or some other upstream process does NOT generate files?
What if KTR fails because of a file parsing error, database connections failure, or other?
What is our data retention policy and, whatever the policy, how do we manage "old" data?

What is the logic for correctly counting "VIEWs"?
What is the logic for correctly counting "INSERTIONs"

What should PDI do if an Oracle Error is encountered, such as constraint violations?
Should PDI somehow identify errors and continue prosessing the next file?

How does PDI notify Technical Operations staff in case a PDI Job fails?

How do I join Insertions to Views?  Is SESSION_ID/PLAYDATA_SESSION_ID the correct way to do so?



Sprint Planning:
  Tasks should not cover more than, perhaps, 16 hours
  STORIES can be estimated as much larger "level of effort" values.
  
  
  
  Campaing Summary Report
  Advertiser Proof of Performance
  Programmer Proof of Performance
      these last 2 are essentially the same report....
	  
	  
	  
	  
Agile Development, Sprint E, 05/04/2012
=========================================
per John Farb, "ETL" is Priority #1 during this Sprint!

What features/functions does ETL still need?

Test and Package XML Parsing
   testing framework
   packaging for migration
   
"Packaging"
   Jenkins 
   project organization
   deploymnet instrunctions

need to update / modify Liquibase to coincide with Aggregation-level DB Schema
 AND
   the "staging" schema/ddl

ETL process MONITORING....
